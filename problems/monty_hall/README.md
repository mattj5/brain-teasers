# Base problem
"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

# TODO
* Make a command line implementation of the Monty Hall problem to give a better intuition.
* Bot tries to predict your pattern of initial door choice and switch/stay strategy to minimise chooser win rate.

## Variant: Host behaviour
* Biased Monty Hall problem where the host always picks the right-most goat what is the new probability?
* The host opens a door and makes the offer to switch 100% of the time if the contestant initially picked the car, and 50% the time otherwise.
* Door is revealed randomly independent of the car being behind the first door chosen.

## Variant: Similar problems
* N doors and {1,...,N-2} goats shown.
